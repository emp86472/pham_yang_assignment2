Merge (complexity): The complexity of Merge is Big O(n^2)
for (list.length) { <runs n times
    for (l.length) <- runs n times  n^2
}
for (list.length) { <runs n times   n

}

n^2 + n

Intersection (complexity): The complexity of Intersection is Big O(n^2)
for (length) {
    for (length) n^2
}
while (length) { n

}
for (length) { n

}
n^2 + 2n
